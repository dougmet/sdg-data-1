Hi Ruben,

Hope you are doing well! Let's use this folder as a shared location for data and metadata still in progress.
If you upload files to this folder, they won't appear on the site yet but I will have access to them.
Let's discuss get these into the right format and uploading them to the Rwanda SDGs page.

Also, there are option for developing a map embed for Rwanda - here's one I worked on with Ghana...

Any questions, please contact me by email or via WhatsApp.

Best wishes,
Chris/Chuck
