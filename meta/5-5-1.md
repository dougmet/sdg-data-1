  The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments is the number of
  seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national
  parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.

  Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number
  of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general
  parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment,
  indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.

  ‘The State of Rwanda commits itself that women are granted at least 30 % of
  posts in decision making organs' (Constitution, Article 9 [4]). The 80 members
  of the Chamber of Deputies are elected as follows: 53 members elected by
  direct universal suffrage through a secret ballot using closed list
  proportional representation, of which at least 30% must be seats reserved for
  women; 24 women (2 elected from each province and from the city of Kigali by
  an electoral college with a women-only ballot); 2 members elected by the
  National Youth Council; and 1 member elected by the Federation of the
  Associations of the Disabled (Constitution, Article 76).

  The indicator is calculated as the total number of seats occupied by women
  divided by the total number of seats occupied in parliament and multiplied by
  100 
comments_limitations: >-
  Unlike the 30% of reserved seats for women , in the event of death and
  resignation the replacement of women parliamentarian coming from the political
  parties is not automatically by a woman instead by the next candidate in the
  party's list.   The role of women parliamentarians needs to be considered
  alongside the role of other government actors such as the executive; and in
  relation to the national gender machinery and women's groups in civil
  society.
