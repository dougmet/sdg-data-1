  Woodland certification assesses management practices against agreed
  environmental standards. Certification requires that wood products are
  harvested legally and sustainably, and that important wildlife habitats are
  identified and are not negatively impacted by management.

  "∙ The  UN identifies a forrest as  “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with
  trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or
  trees able to reach these thresholds in situ"".  The definition used in th UK
  calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than 20%. ∙
  Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001,
  becoming a regular annual collation in 2004.  New certificates may relate to
  existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted
  areas.   For further information please see JNCC Biodiversity Indicator
